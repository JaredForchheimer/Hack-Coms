    "summary": "CNN's analysis of early voting data for upcoming elections in New Jersey, Virginia, and New York City offers early insights, but emphasizes these are hints, not definitive predictions for Election Day.\n\nKey findings include:\n\n*   **New Jersey:** Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherrill is in a stronger position than Kamala Harris was at the same point last year, with Democrats showing a greater lead in both mail and in-person early voting turnout compared to Republicans.\n*   **Virginia:** Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger also appears in a slightly stronger position than Harris was last year, largely due to mail ballots (which typically favor Democrats) making up a larger share of the pre-election vote, and a narrowing gap in early in-person turnout between counties that previously favored Trump and those that favored Harris.\n*   **New York City:** While older Democratic voters initially turned out more (benefiting Andrew Cuomo), the overall early electorate is younger than in previous mayoral elections and has become progressively younger over the week, indicating increased activity among younger voters who tend to support Zohran Mamdani. Despite some geographic areas favoring Cuomo, this alone isn't enough to reverse Mamdani's lead among early Democratic voters based on primary patterns.",

    "summary": "Former President Barack Obama campaigned on Saturday for Democratic gubernatorial nominees Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, ahead of Tuesday's elections. Obama urged voters to break with President Donald Trump, delivering sharp criticism of Trump's administration, accusing it of weakening democratic norms, concentrating economic power, and exhibiting \"lawlessness and recklessness.\"\n\nObama emphasized the importance of these elections as a \"temperature check\" on the nation's political mood and a precursor for future midterms, stressing that \"elections do matter.\" Both Spanberger and Sherrill are favored in their respective races, though their victories are not guaranteed, and the outcomes are seen as significant indicators of the public's sentiment.",
